# Playground

A small repo for bite-sized demos, examples, and experiments.  
This is a place for quick prototypes, PoCs, and scratch code — not production-ready projects.

## What you’ll find here
- tiny self-contained examples
- experiments with libraries / approaches
- quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- notes and drafts worth keeping

## How to use it
1. Browse folders by topic — each folder is an independent example.
2. If an example has dependencies, they live next to it (e.g. `requirements.txt` / `package.json`).
3. Run it, tweak it, break it — it’s a sandbox 🙂
